This project trains a deep convolutional neural network to recognize "ahem" sounds in a podcast episode before getting published at [worldofpiggy.com/podcast](Link URL) 
Two sets of audio files are required: a negative sample with clean voice/sound and a negative one with "ahem" sounds concatenated.

### How do I get set up? ###
Once the training audio files are provided, just train the network with 
<command>

A GPU is recommended as under the conditions specific to this example at least 5 epochs are required to obtain 81% accuracy.
